# Projected - Variational Quantum Dynamics (p-VQD)

This repository contains the source code of the p-VQD algorithm to reproduce the results of the paper "An efficient quantum algorithm for the time evolution of parameterized circuits" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04579).

At the moment, the Qiskit version required is


| qiskit              | 0.24.0 |
|---------------------|--------|
| qiskit-aer          | 0.7.6  |
| qiskit-aqua         | 0.8.2  |
| qiskit-ibm-provider | 0.12.1 |

## Content of the repository

- **pVQD.py** : contains the actual class of the pVQD algorithm , with methods to evaluate the overlap, the gradient, the observables and run 
- **pauli_function.py** : contains functions to prepare Pauli operators and Hamiltonians for different physical systems. In this case, we create the Transverse Field Ising Model
- **ansatze.py** : a file to contain the functions that return quantum circuit ansatze, in the future it will be updated with new ansatze
- **example.py** : an example to use the pVQD to simulate the Transverse Field Ising Model on an open chain of 3 qubits
- **plotter.py** : simple script to plot the results of the pVQD calculations and compare them to the exact classical simulation
- **data** : a folder that contains some pre-produced data to plot
