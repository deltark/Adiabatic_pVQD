# Adiabatic Projected - Variational Quantum Dynamics

This repository contains the code used for a project I worked on during my Master's at EPFL. It is based on the work of Stefano Barison : https://github.com/StefanoBarison/p-VQD.

This project adapts the time-evolution algorithm p-VQD for adiabatic evolution in order to retrieve the ground state of a given final Hamiltonian, similarly to VQE.
This was implemented using both Qiskit (Python) and Yao (Julia).
